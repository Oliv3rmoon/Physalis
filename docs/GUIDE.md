# Physalis guide

How Physalis updates, how its Plex source works, and the guide of the app it is built on, which covers everything else it does: sources, browsing, the programme guide, playback, controls, the phone remote and building from source.

Back to the [README](../README.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The sections from **ProsperoTV's guide** on are that app's guide as it shipped in 01.000.090. Where they name ProsperoTV's own updates or prosperostore.net, the **Updates** section below is what applies to Physalis: it updates from its own releases.

## Updates

Once per launch Physalis asks GitHub for the newest release of
[Oliv3rmoon/Physalis](https://github.com/Oliv3rmoon/Physalis/releases) that is not a
pre-release. When it is newer than the one installed and carries `PPSA99003.zip` and
`SHA256SUMS`, the app offers **Update now**, **What's new** and **Later**; **Update now** downloads
the ZIP, checks it against `SHA256SUMS`, and replaces the app's files once it has closed. Your data
in `/data/prosperotv` is not touched. Like ProsperoTV, it needs filesystem access for this (the
payload loader on port 9021 that a ShadowMountPlus setup runs); without it, update by copying the
folder as above. A release ZIP built by this repository's workflow can be checked with
`gh attestation verify PPSA99003.zip -R Oliv3rmoon/Physalis`.

## Plex

A Plex server is one more source in **Sources**. Its movies and TV shows are in **On demand**, in
the screens an Xtream account's use; it has no live channels, so Live TV says so and opens On
demand.

**Signing in.** In **Sources**, choose **Add Plex**. A four-character code appears beside a QR
code. On a phone or computer signed in to Plex, open [plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link) (the QR
code opens it) and enter the code; the TV asks plex.tv every two seconds and the code lasts about
15 minutes. Every server the account reaches, its own and those shared with it, then becomes a
source, and the first is used. Sources shows the account's name, **Find servers** (servers shared
since, with no new code) and **Sign out** (forgets the account on this console and removes its
servers). In your Plex account's device list the console is **Physalis (PS5)**.

**What works.**

- Movie libraries as Movies and show libraries as TV shows, each library a category, with seasons
  and episodes, posters, plot, cast, genres, year and rating. The lists are saved on the console
  and refreshed on the source's schedule, like an Xtream account's.
- Search, Home and Continue, newest first, hidden categories and parental rules, as for other
  on-demand titles.
- Resuming where a title was left, on any device (Plex's resume point); progress told to the server
  every ten seconds and when playback stops (sent in the background, so the menu comes back at
  once); the title marked watched when it plays to its end.
- The connection: the local address at home, the remote one away, Plex's relay as a last resort,
  https before http, as [PlxNative](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native) ranks them, all of
  them asked at once. A connection counts when its `/identity` names the server. Plain http is
  tried only on your own network (when plex.tv says the server stands behind your router), since
  over http any box could answer for it; a `*.plex.direct` name is dialled at the address plex.tv
  gives for it, so https works behind a router that blocks such names. The server is looked for
  once per launch, and until it has answered nothing is sent to it: no poster, list or title, and
  no token. One that does not answer says **Can't be reached** in Sources; its saved lists stay,
  and **Options** looks for it again. Signing in saves only servers that answered; **Find
  servers** adds the others later.
- Sound and subtitle tracks from the playback menu, as far as the player reads them in the file or
  in the transcoder's stream.

**Direct play and the transcoder.** A file plays as it is when the PS5 player decodes it: MP4,
MOV, Matroska, WebM or MPEG-TS, with H.264 (8-bit), HEVC or VP9 video up to 3840 x 2160 and AAC,
AC-3, E-AC-3, MP2, MP3 or DTS sound, in one part. Anything else (AVI, AV1, 10-bit H.264, TrueHD,
a film in several parts) plays through the server's universal transcoder over HLS, which copies
H.264 or HEVC video when the file has it and sends AAC, AC-3 or E-AC-3 sound. A file that should
play as it is but does not open falls back to the transcoder. What the server can transcode is up
to the server (its processor, and Plex Pass for hardware transcoding).

**Limits.**

- No Plex Home profiles: the account that signs in is the one used.
- No live TV or DVR, music or photos from Plex, and no Watchlist, Discover or Plex's own hubs.
- Search is the app's own, over the downloaded lists; Plex's server search is not used.
- No quality choice for the transcoder: it aims at the PS5's limit, 4K at up to 40 Mbit/s.
- Plex servers are not sent to another console with **Share with another console**, not on the
  phone remote's source form, and not in settings backups: each console signs in itself, and
  again after a restore.
- Not yet run on a console with a real Plex server: the host tests check it against recorded
  answers from plex.tv and a server.

**The tokens.** They are kept as Xtream passwords are: each server's token in its source's
password, the account's token and this console's client identifier in `prosperotv-plex-v1.txt`
beside the sources (`/data/prosperotv/config`, or the title's storage). A backup leaves the Plex
servers out, and signing out overwrites their rows in the file rather than only removing them.
They travel
in `X-Plex-Token` headers only, to the server they belong to, never in an address, so no cache,
receipt or failure report has them, and the diagnostic log never contains them or the account's
name.

The Plex API is used as [PlxNative](https://github.com/GLinnik21/plx-native) (a fast native Plex
client for LG webOS by GLinnik21, GPL-3.0) documents and uses it: its notes and code were the
reference for the sign-in, the connection ranking, the transcoder's parameters and the timeline.
No PlxNative code is included.

## ProsperoTV's guide

![ProsperoTV Live TV screen](images/prosperotv.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Version 01.000.020 brings a new interface.** It is built on
> [ps5-homebrew-ui](https://github.com/LedyBacer/ps5-homebrew-ui) and lives in
> [`opengl-ui/`](../opengl-ui/); the catalog, the stores, and the player are the ones earlier
> versions used. Coming from 01.000.015 or older: see [Updating ProsperoTV](#updating-prosperotv).

## Highlights

- Bring your own channels: add an HTTP(S) M3U playlist or connect an Xtream
  Codes account. ProsperoTV ships with no third-party list of its own.
- Search by name and filter by country, language, category, and advertised
  quality with continuous controller paging.
- Decode H.264, HEVC, and VP9 through native PS5 video paths at resolutions up
  to 4K.
- Keep the catalog, favorites, recent channels, and source state fast and
  persistent under `/data/prosperotv`, where an update never touches them.
- Update from inside the app: a newer version listed on
  [prosperostore.net](https://prosperostore.net) is offered at launch with its release
  notes, downloaded, and installed in place.
- Handle live HLS buffering, stale segments, alternate URLs, and failed feeds
  without destabilizing the next playback session.
- Use a full-screen OpenGL interface at up to 4K with DualSense navigation,
  channels drawn as television sets, an alphabet beside every list, native
  text input, dedicated Favorites, and an optional playback statistics overlay.

## Project foundations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Built on the [PS5 Native App Boilerplate](https://github.com/LedyBacer/ps5-native-app-boilerplate).**
> ProsperoTV retains its C++20 application structure, reproducible clean-room
> runtime, FSELF tooling, tests, deployment flow, and release automation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ProsperoTV includes no channel list.** It is an independent client: every
> channel comes from a source you add, this project hosts no streams, and
> channel availability can change without notice.

| Identity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Shell title | `ProsperoTV` |
| Title ID | `PPSA99003` |
| Shell category | Media |
| Current version | `01.000.090` |
| Release-version source | [`sce_sys/param.json`](../sce_sys/param.json) |
| Writable data | `/data/prosperotv`; the title's own `/download0` when filesystem access is not available |

## Features

### Sources

- Add your own sources: HTTP(S) M3U/M3U8
  playlists, Xtream Codes accounts (masked password entry), MAC-code portals
  (Stalker/Ministra style), and tuners or servers on the home network such as
  HDHomeRun and Tvheadend.
- Keep several sources, each with its own cache, visible categories, and
  refresh schedule: daily, weekly, or only when asked.
- Load large providers: up to 250,000 channels from one source, read as the
  list downloads.
- Choose which of a provider's categories appear. Hiding a parent hides all of
  its subcategories.
- Add and edit playlists and accounts from a phone or a computer with the
  [phone remote](#phone-remote), instead of the on-screen keyboard.
- In Sources, R2 opens per-source HTTP settings: user agent, referrer and custom
  request headers. Enter one `Name: value` at a time on TV (empty saves, `-`
  clears all), or paste up to 16 lines / 4 KiB in the paired phone editor.
  Saved custom values stay hidden on the phone; a blank field keeps them.
  Channel user agents/referrers and built-in authentication take precedence.
  Custom headers stay on the source's HTTP origin and are removed on redirects
  to another origin. USB playlists use each initial stream URL as their origin.

### Browsing

- Open the last verified catalog at once from a local cache while a refresh
  runs in the background.
- Browse Live TV by the provider's own categories and subcategories, shown as
  the row of filters above the channels, beside Favorites and Recent.
- Search by channel name, and filter by country, language, category, and
  advertised quality, with the native PS5 keyboard.
- See channel logos on the tiles and on the large television.
- Preview the focused live channel, with sound, on the large television after
  a moment on it.
- Turn pages by holding L2 or R2, faster the longer they are held, in Live TV,
  Movies, Series and the provider's categories; a held Up or Down goes faster
  too, in those lists and in Sources. Jump by letter with the column beside
  Live TV, and beside Movies and TV shows in On demand (Right from the list,
  which turns it to Title A–Z).
- Keep up to 65,536 favorites, organized in named folders.
- Hide the channels that did not open the last time, and start on the channel
  watched last, from Settings.
- Return to the same screen, group, page, and channel after playback closes.

### Programme guide

- See what each channel is showing now and next, from the guide a playlist or
  an account points to.
- Open the full grid of channels and hours, and start a channel from it.
- Search programmes by title, not only channels by name.
- Play a programme that has already been shown, on channels whose provider
  keeps a catch-up archive.

### Movies and series

- Browse movies, shows, seasons, and episodes from an Xtream account or a
  classified M3U playlist in **On demand**, next to Live TV.
- See the provider's newest movies and shows first in every category, by the
  date an Xtream provider added them; titles it gives no date follow by title,
  so an M3U playlist is listed by title.
- Open Movies or TV shows from the saved copy, read in the background while
  the status line says so; the On demand menu counts both without loading
  either, and switching between them keeps the list left at hand.
- Carry on with a show from **Continue**, at the top of its episode list: the
  episode watched last, from the time it was left at.
- Play H.264 and HEVC in MP4 or Matroska, up to 4K.

### While watching

- Zap with up and down, go back to the channel watched before with one
  button, or pick another channel from a list over the picture.
- See a banner with the channel's name and its programme when a channel opens
  or when asked for.
- Choose among the audio tracks a channel carries, and show its subtitles.
- Press Options for the playback menu: one page with audio, sound delay,
  subtitles and their size and color, the picture's shape, chapters and
  quality, each opening a list with the value in use ticked. Picture shapes
  are shown as small previews, and Fit names the video's own shape.
- Choose an HLS rendition manually, or enable
  [Auto quality reduction](AUTOMATIC_HLS_QUALITY.md) for buffering on a slow
  connection. Auto only reduces quality and requires compatible renditions.
- Pause live TV and go back a few minutes.
- Set a sleep timer.
- Record live TV to USB with Touchpad, or schedule a recording or reminder from
  the guide's Options menu. Keep the app running; recording uses an additional
  provider connection.
- Watch two or four live channels side by side in Multiview, with sound
  following the focused one. Four 720p H.264 feeds are validated on hardware;
  higher resolutions depend on the decoder resources available.
- Codec, resolution, frame rate, and bitrate appear for five seconds when playback
  starts, with the sound's format, channels, and whether the console's decoder
  (HW) or software (SW) is decoding it, then disappear like the bottom playback
  banner. Press **Touchpad + R1** to show them again for five seconds, or turn
  on **Stats line** under Troubleshooting in Settings to keep them on screen.

### Picture and sound

- Play HLS and direct MPEG-TS streams with H.264 or HEVC video, and direct
  WebM streams with VP9 Profile 0, through the PS5's hardware decoders.
- Show HDR10 and HLG channels as HDR, with SDR tone mapping when HDR output is
  not available.
- Present each field of an interlaced broadcast separately to keep its motion.
- Play AAC, MP2, AC-3, E-AC-3, and DTS sound (the core of a DTS-HD track), with
  Stereo by default and optional [decoded 5.1 surround](SURROUND_AUDIO.md)
  for compatible HDMI receivers.
- Keep the picture in step with the sound: frames are timed against the sound
  being played.
- Adapt buffering to live HLS timing, and recover from stale segments and
  alternate addresses without giving up on the channel.
- Show a tuning screen until the channel's first picture, and say why a
  channel did not open: HTTP status, regional restriction, unsupported
  encryption or codec, malformed playlist, or decoder error.

### Household

- Lock adult categories behind a parental PIN, and switch to a mode that shows
  only the channels for children.
- Set a daily viewing allowance and bedtime for the children's mode.
- Keep favorites, recent channels, and sources separate for each person signed
  in on the console.
- Use the interface in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese,
  Dutch, Arabic, or Hebrew, with right-to-left layouts where appropriate.
  Follow the console language or choose an override in Settings and restart.
  Provider content keeps its own text.
- Back up sources, favorites, and settings to a USB drive, and restore them on
  this console or another.
- [Share sources and favorites between consoles](CONSOLE_SHARING.md) over
  an encrypted local connection, verifying the receiver's fingerprint first.

### The app

- Control the app from a phone's browser with the
  [phone remote](#phone-remote).
- Update in place: a newer version is offered at launch with **Update now**,
  **What's new**, and **Later**, and everything saved is kept.
- Keep all data under `/data/prosperotv`, where an update never touches it; a
  failed refresh leaves the last good catalog untouched.
- Send a useful problem report: a diagnostic log switch in Settings (off by
  default, no account details), and a failure report saved to a USB drive.
- Recover a minimal report after a caught fatal signal and skip automatic
  playback on the next launch. Forced termination and power loss cannot be
  recorded by the crash handler.
- Use a full-screen OpenGL interface at up to 4K, built with the
  [ps5-homebrew-ui](https://github.com/LedyBacer/ps5-homebrew-ui) kit,
  with fonts for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean channel
  names, interface sounds, and a Reduce motion setting. Settings also offers
  Dusk, Ocean and Forest themes, opaque high-contrast menus, and 25% larger text
  (applied when the menu next opens). Channel artwork and video retain their colors.
  A black screensaver protects idle menus and paused video after 1, 5 or 10 minutes;
  five minutes is the default, and it can be turned off. The first button wakes
  the screen without activating a control. Active multiview stays visible.

Provider requirements and validation for these features are in
[the implementation guide](ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

## Video support

| Codec | Supported path | Output classes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H.264 / AVC | MPEG-TS, HLS, MP4 and Matroska; Baseline, Main, and High profiles within the configured level limits | 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p |
| HEVC | MPEG-TS, HLS, MP4 and Matroska; Main / Main10, 8-bit or 10-bit 4:2:0, SDR output | 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p |
| VP9 | Direct WebM; Profile 0, 8-bit 4:2:0 | 1080p, 1440p, 2160p |

Sources up to 1080p use a 1920×1080 presentation surface. Native 1440p video
is scaled to the 4K output surface, while 2160p video is decoded and presented
at 3840×2160. Codec and renderer details are documented in
[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [Testing](TESTING.md).

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| D-pad / left stick | Move focus, faster the longer Up or Down is held; Right past the last column (in On demand, Right) reaches the letters |
| Cross | Select, open, or play |
| Circle | Back, dismiss, or clear active filters |
| Square | Add or remove a favorite |
| Triangle | Open advanced search and filters |
| L1 / R1 | Switch between Home, Live TV, On demand, Favorites, Sources, Settings, and About |
| L2 / R2 | Previous or next page; hold to keep turning, two, four and eight pages at a time after 3, 5 and 7 seconds |
| Triangle on a configurable source | Edit the custom M3U URL or Xtream account |
| Square in Sources | Cycle daily, weekly and manual refresh |
| Touchpad in Live TV / Favorites | Provider categories / favorite folders |
| R1 inside categories / folders | Channel number pad: enter a number, then Watch |
| L1 inside categories / folders | Rename, hide/restore, or move channels in the list |
| R3 in the channel browser | Open the programme guide |
| L3 in Live TV / Favorites | Open Multiview; Square chooses a channel, Triangle switches two/four tiles, R3 mutes, Cross opens full screen |
| Options | Refresh the selected catalog source |
| Cross during playback | Pause or resume; in the open channel list, watch the channel |
| L2 during live TV | Open or close the channel list |
| Up at the top of a screen, or Circle on Live TV | Focus the tabs; Left / Right change the tab, Down, Cross or Circle go back in; Left of Home is Search |
| Circle during playback | Close the open panel, or stop playback and return to the browser |
| Options during playback | Open or close the audio/subtitle/picture panel |
| L1 / R1 in the playback panel | Switch between Audio, Subtitles and Picture |
| Touchpad + R1 during playback | Show video and sound codecs and FPS/performance statistics for five seconds |

During playback, Options then L1 opens Picture. Fit preserves the decoded picture's
proportions by default; Stretch fills the screen, while 4:3 and 16:9 correct
anamorphic or incorrectly advertised proportions. The choice lasts for the current
playback session. Picture correction applies to live TV, movies and episodes.

### TV remote

The television's own remote works too, over HDMI-CEC, as it does in the
console's menus. Turn on **Settings > System > HDMI > Enable HDMI Device Link**
on the console (and the TV's CEC setting, for example BRAVIA Sync on Sony TVs).
The remote can be used alongside the controller or instead of it.

| Remote key | In the menu | During playback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arrows | Move focus; Up from the top of a screen reaches the tabs, Left / Right there change the tab, and Left of Home is Search | As the D-pad |
| OK | Select, open, or play | As Cross: pause or resume, or watch the channel in the open list |
| Back | Back | Close the open panel, or stop playback |
| Play / Pause | Play the channel in focus | Pause or resume, even with a list or the panel open |
| Rewind / Fast forward | Previous or next page | Step back and on, as Left and Right |
| Channel − / Channel + | As L1 / R1, if the TV passes them on | As L1 / R1: previous or next channel on live TV |
| Menu / Options | As Options | Open or close the playback panel |

Which keys a television passes on is up to the television; arrows, OK and Back
are the ones every CEC remote sends.

## Channels, lists and playback in detail

Provider channel numbers (`tvg-chno` / `channel-number` in M3U, `num` in Xtream,
`number` in MAC portals) appear in the channel hero and playback channel list.
Numbers such as `7.2` and leading zeros are preserved. Channels without a number
keep their alphabetical position. The number pad searches only the current
visible list; when numbers repeat, narrow the list before choosing one. Existing
cached lists acquire provider numbers on their next refresh.

In Live TV or Favorites, focus a channel and open Touchpad, then L1 for channel
options. Names are saved locally without changing provider IDs, guide matching,
or parental rules. An empty name or **Use provider name** restores the original.
**Hidden channels** lets you restore individual channels, including when the
current list is empty. A hidden provider category must also be shown for its
channels to appear.

**Move up/down** swaps a channel with its visible neighbor. Live lists share one
saved order; Favorites and its folders share a separate order. Both survive
refreshes and restarts; new channels are appended alphabetically. **Reset list
order** restores alphabetical order for the current kind of list.

During playback, Options opens the Playback sheet with Sound, Subtitles,
Picture and Video. Picture offers Fit, Stretch, corrected 4:3 or 16:9, Fill
(crop), and 125% or 150% zoom, each with a preview of its shape. Controls and captions stay within the visible crop. Text subtitles
have Small/Medium/Large sizes and White/Yellow/Cyan colors; image subtitles
retain the provider's artwork. These choices are saved for the next video.

In multiview, Touchpad keeps the selected live channel playing in a corner while you browse lists or the programme guide. L3 in the live list closes picture in picture.

Live TV also offers Recently added (first seen by this app) and Most watched (successful viewing sessions), with history saved separately for each profile and source.

On Demand: Square opens provider title details; R3 filters loaded metadata by genre/year or changes sorting (Recently added, the default, or Title A-Z, Title Z-A, Newest year, Highest rating; a show's episodes default to episode order). Movie details are fetched when opened and retained in the local cache.

## Phone remote

Connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi, then select **Settings → Pair a phone**
on the TV. Scan the QR code (or type the displayed address) and enter the
six-digit code on the website. The code expires after two minutes, is accepted
once, and is cancelled when you close the pairing screen. No app installation
or internet connection is needed for the remote. The dialog closes automatically
when a newly paired or remembered browser connects, and the TV shows "Phone connected".

The TV remembers up to eight browsers. A saved browser reconnects after a page
reload or app restart without another code. Its cookie lasts one year; private
browsing, clearing cookies, or a changed console IP may require pairing again.
Use **Forget this phone** on the website or **Forget paired phones** in TV
Settings to revoke access. Pairing must be saved on the console before the
website reports success.

Use the arrows and OK to navigate, Back to return or stop playback, and the
section and favorite buttons for the corresponding controller actions.
While a channel is playing, **Favorite** adds or removes that channel without
stopping playback; the phone confirms the change after it is saved.
Type a channel name on the phone and tap **Search on TV** (or the keyboard's Search
key). **Clear** removes the text query; existing category/country filters still
apply. Search accepts up to 39 Unicode characters and is available in the
channel browser. It also works while the TV's native search keyboard is open.
The **Search & filters on TV** button opens the existing advanced search panel.

Open **Channels and guide** to browse the active source on the phone, search
channel names or programmes on now, and read upcoming programmes. Tap a channel
to watch it, including while another channel or movie is playing. Hidden and
parentally restricted channels stay unavailable; changing sources on the TV
requires reloading the phone's channel list.

The **Volume** sliders in TV Settings and on the phone control the same saved
ProsperoTV volume, including live playback and interface sounds. Zero mutes it;
100% keeps the stream's original level. This does not change the television's
hardware volume.

The remote uses HTTP on your local network. Use it on a trusted LAN and do not
forward its port to the internet. The app requests port 8888 and uses an assigned
port when that is unavailable. Use the current address on the pairing screen;
the saved browser credential remains valid if only the port changes. Controller
use continues even if the remote cannot start.

## Requirements

Building requires Linux, WSL, or a Linux CI runner. On Ubuntu, Debian, or WSL:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang-18 clang-format-18 clang-tidy-18 curl git lld-18 make \
  pkg-config python3 python3-pip python3-venv tar unzip wget libsqlite3-dev \
  cmake ninja-build libpng-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

The build downloads, verifies, and caches the public PS5 Payload SDK, zlib,
PacBrew's SQLite port, and GoogleTest below the
ignored `.deps/` directory. No proprietary Sony SDK, firmware module,
encryption key, or game asset is included or fetched.

Run the read-only prerequisite check before building:

```bash
make doctor
```

See [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) and
[Native tooling](NATIVE_TOOLING.md) for detailed environment setup.

## Build

[`sce_sys/param.json`](../sce_sys/param.json) is the source of truth for the app
identity and release version. Keep `PPSA99003` when publishing an update;
changing the title ID creates a separate PS5 title.

```bash
# Lint and run the host tests of the shared catalog, stores, and player.
make lint
make test

# The released app: the interface in opengl-ui/ on top of those sources.
opengl-ui/tools/run-tests.sh
opengl-ui/ps5/assemble.sh
make -C ../prosperotv-ui-build app
```

Release outputs are written beside the repository:

```text
../prosperotv-ui-build/dist/PPSA99003/       complete title folder
../prosperotv-ui-build/dist/PPSA99003.zip    the release download
```

GitHub Releases provide `PPSA99003.zip`, which contains the complete
`PPSA99003` title folder, and `SHA256SUMS`. See
[`opengl-ui/README.md`](../opengl-ui/README.md) for how that build is put
together. A release ZIP built by GitHub Actions can
be checked with the GitHub CLI:
`gh attestation verify PPSA99003.zip -R ThatGuyKalvin/ProsperoTV`
(releases built from now on, not earlier ones).

The repository root still builds the interface of 01.000.015 and earlier
(`make check`, `make app`); it shares the catalog, stores, and player with
the released app and is kept for their tests. It is no longer released.

## Install and development deployment

Extract `PPSA99003.zip` and upload its complete `PPSA99003` folder to
`/data/homebrew`, producing `/data/homebrew/PPSA99003/eboot.bin`.
[ShadowMountPlus](https://github.com/drakmor/ShadowMountPlus) then puts
ProsperoTV on the home screen.

Do not upload the ZIP itself or copy only `eboot.bin`; the app also requires
its runtime module, fonts, sounds, artwork, metadata, and the two helper
programs beside `eboot.bin`.

ProsperoTV asks the console's payload loader (port 9021, which a
ShadowMountPlus setup already runs) for filesystem access when it starts. With
it, the app keeps its files in `/data/prosperotv` and can update itself.
Without it, the app runs in its own storage as earlier versions did and is
updated by hand.

### Updating ProsperoTV

From 01.000.020 on, ProsperoTV checks [prosperostore.net](https://prosperostore.net)
once per launch. When a newer version is listed it offers **Update now**,
**What's new**, and **Later**. The update downloads the release, closes the
app, and replaces its files; sources, favorites, recent channels, and settings
stay as they are. An app installed as an image cannot update itself.

Coming from 01.000.015 or older, update by hand once:

1. Fully close ProsperoTV.
2. If you installed `PPSA99003.ffpfsc`, delete it from `/data/homebrew`; the
   image form is no longer published, and the folder and the image must not
   both be in ShadowMountPlus scan paths.
3. Upload the complete `PPSA99003` folder from the ZIP to `/data/homebrew`,
   replacing the old one.
4. Restart ShadowMountPlus or the PS5, and wait for the title to be
   rediscovered before launching it.

Keeping the `PPSA99003` title ID lets the new version find the sources,
favorites, history, and account the old one saved; it copies them to
`/data/prosperotv` the first time it starts.

Xtream support is for credentials supplied by the user. ProsperoTV does not
include, sell, or discover provider accounts. The server, username, and
password are stored in a local record beside the app's other data and are never written to the
application log; the credential record is not encrypted, so do not share title
data copied from the console.


## Test and quality gates

```bash
make test                      # GoogleTest unit suite and Python integration tests
make lint                      # formatting, static analysis, metadata, and shell checks
opengl-ui/tools/run-tests.sh   # the interface and its logic, under ASan and UBSan
```

Host tests cover M3U and Xtream catalog parsing and persistence, HLS parsing,
HTTP error classification, MPEG-TS access-unit handling, VP9/WebM parsing,
native-app layout, runtime handoff, and presentation constraints. Hardware
acceptance is performed separately on PS5 with bounded channel samples,
decoder telemetry, and teardown checks.

GitHub Actions runs linting, the host tests, and deterministic runtime
reproduction on every pull request and version tag, and checks that the tag matches
`contentVersion`. A pull request's build is uploaded under its number and
commit: see [Pull-request builds](PULL_REQUEST_BUILDS.md). The same run
builds the released app from `opengl-ui/` on a clean machine, fetching every
dependency at its pinned version. A version tag also publishes: the ZIP that
run built is attached to a GitHub Release with its `SHA256SUMS` and the notes
in `docs/releases/<version>.md`. No release is built anywhere else. A push to
`main` builds nothing; a build on `main` is started by hand (**Actions**,
**Build**, **Run workflow**).

## Versioning and releases

`contentVersion` in [`sce_sys/param.json`](../sce_sys/param.json) drives the
packaged metadata, the version on the About page, the Git tag, and the GitHub Release. It uses the
PS5 `NN.NNN.NNN` format without a `v` prefix.

```bash
# After updating param.json and passing the release gates:
git tag 01.000.050
git push origin main 01.000.050
```

The workflow rejects a mismatched tag, builds the app, and publishes the
release with the notes in `docs/releases/01.000.050.md`. See
[Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for the coordinated metadata fields.

A release is made by pushing the version tag and in no other way: the
workflow builds, attests, and publishes `PPSA99003.zip` and `SHA256SUMS`, and
files are not attached by hand. If the tag has no release yet, the workflow
creates it; if a release exists without a ZIP (notes written in advance, or a
draft), it adds the two files and leaves the title and notes alone; if a
release already has a ZIP, nothing is replaced and the run ends with a
warning.

## Stream compatibility and limitations

- Public IPTV URLs can disappear, move, become GeoIP-restricted, require
  provider-specific headers, or reject access at any time.
- DRM and encrypted HLS media are intentionally unsupported.
- VP9 currently supports direct, video-only WebM Profile 0 streams. DASH,
  fragmented MP4, WebM audio, VP9 Profile 2, and general Matroska features are
  outside the supported path.
- Interlaced H.264 presents each field separately, preserving broadcast motion
  at 50 or 60 fields per second. Spatial bob reduces vertical detail in each
  field; it does not perform motion-adaptive reconstruction. Interlaced streams
  rejected by the hardware decoder use bounded software decoding up to 1080i.
- MPEG-TS playback supports H.264 and 8-bit/10-bit HEVC video. Main10 uses hardware
  decoding and GPU presentation. BT.2020/PQ and HLG select HDR10 output; HLG
  converts to PQ, and rejected HDR output requests fall back to SDR tone mapping.
  Static mastering/content-light metadata is retained, but custom HDMI metadata
  forwarding is unverified. The Main10 presentation path currently requires
  decoder pitch to match visible width (standard 720p/1080p/1440p/2160p widths).
  Unsupported audio may
  continue as silent video when the video path remains valid.
- A source may hold up to 250,000 channels; a larger one loads its first
  250,000 and says so. A list of that size takes about 75 MiB of memory and
  a minute or more to download from a slow provider.
- An On Demand list (movies, or shows) may hold up to 250,000 titles; a
  longer one keeps its first 250,000 and says so. A list of 200,000 films
  takes about 300 MiB of memory while it is open and a minute and a half
  to download; an entry the provider sends malformed is left out rather
  than failing the list.
- Catalog metadata describes a channel but cannot guarantee that its current
  stream is online, correctly labeled, or compatible with the PS5 decoder.

ProsperoTV displays the most specific detected cause when a channel cannot be
played. A channel failure does not imply that the app, the source, or the
console is unavailable.

## Roadmap

Ideas for future versions are kept in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). None of them is
scheduled or promised; issues asking for one, or for something else, are welcome.
